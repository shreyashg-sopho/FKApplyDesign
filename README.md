This is project work that I have done for today.

there is one abstract class which is called Board. In order to change the dimensions of the board or increase the number of players in the game this would help a lot.

The Create_Borad class extends the  Boards and intializes the board along with opther methods that are needed in the board.

There is a Player class which also extend the Create Board class thus enabling them to use the methods of Create Board class.

There are basically two types of players:
1)Human_player which is an extension of the Player class.
2)Computer_Player whish is an extension of the Player class as well.
