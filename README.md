This is project work that I have done for today.

there is one abstract class which is called Board. In order to change the dimensions of the board or increase the number of players in the game this would help a lot.

The Create_Borad class extends the  Boards and intializes the board along with opther methods that are needed in the board.

There is a Player class which also extend the Create Board class thus enabling them to use the methods of Create Board class.

There are basically two types of players:
1)Human_player which is an extension of the Player class.
2)Computer_Player whish is an extension of the Player class as well.


The cells file fulfills the first condition of creating the board for the game of 3 x 3.
The BothHuman file will generate two players of Human types.
The MachineHuman file will generate two players , one of which is Human and other one is a bot.
The final class is an errornous file. Please ignore it.
The final_for_saturday file implements the comple paying with all the conditions and rules of the game along with it declares the winner.


IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE :
The code currently does not generate an error when the Use tries to make a Cross on a spot which was not initially blank.
Some redundancy can be improved to optimize time wise.
